# Double_Well_Tunneling
Quantum Tunneling Effects under a Double-Well System with one particle trapped in the box. 
Introducing new methods of computation with dimensionless schrodinger equation. Numerical methods are adopted to calculate the wavefunction over finite wells. Eigenergy levels are obtained based on the convergence of each 'wavefunction attemp'.
